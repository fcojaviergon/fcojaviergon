## 🧠 About Me

I design and build intelligent digital systems that combine strong engineering foundations with strategic business thinking.

My current focus is developing an **AI Innovation Copilot** — a multi-agent system designed to support complex innovation processes through:

- Multi-agent architecture
- Structured tool orchestration
- Semantic memory (pgvector / Timescale)
- FastAPI + React full-stack architecture
- Redis & Celery task orchestration
- Docker-based deployment

I’m passionate about building systems that don’t just respond — but **reason, plan, collaborate, and create measurable impact**.
